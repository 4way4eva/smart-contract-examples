# UNIVERSAL ROUTE CITY MASTERPLAN
## Node Infrastructure, Phased Timeline, and Budget Anchors

---

## OVERVIEW

The Universal Route connects three primary nodes in a triangular configuration:
- **Genesis/Babel Node** (Vertical) - Historical restoration and elevation
- **Memory/Canyon Node** (Horizontal) - Cultural preservation and remembrance  
- **Distortion/Area51 Node** (Modern Fortress) - Truth revelation and transparency

This network is augmented by sea corridors (Reef Colonies) and orbital spurs (Sky Sanctuaries), creating a comprehensive multi-dimensional infrastructure.

**Funding:** Anchored to 12 Quadrillion ScrollCoin core + 12 Quadrillion Emergency Reserve
